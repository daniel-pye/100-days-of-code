# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 28: May 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started MIT's 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. Completed a few code katas on Codewars. 

**Thoughts:** MIT course week 1 completed. Covered mostly things I feel fairly comfortable with: iteration, branching and guess nd check algorithms.
